```{r}
## install.packages('gapminder')
## install.packages('DT')
## install.packages('tibble')

library("gapminder")
library("DT")
library("tibble")
```


Looking at gapminder
```{r gapminder view, echo=FALSE} 
gapminder
```

Looking at mtcars dataframe
```{r mtcars exploration, echo=FALSE}
mtcars
```

The mean for mpg was `r mean(mtcars$mpg)`
```{r mtcars mpg, echo=FALSE}
mtcars["mpg"] #this with the single [ ] will still give us a table but it only has the column of interest
mtcars[["mpg"]] #this with the double [[ ]] will only pull out all of the variables of interest meaning that it only has the values from the column of interest and it is no longer a table formatting for the information --> this can also be done by using mtcars$mpg
mean(mtcars[["mpg"]]) #the double [[ ]] is needed to run this without an error
mean(mtcars$mpg) #this will do the same thing as the double [[ ]]
```
Viewing mtcars cylinder
```{r mtcars cylinder, echo=FALSE}
mtcars$cyl #this is just giving the values not in a table formatting
unique(mtcars$cyl) #this is giving a list of all of the values that appear in the list, whether they are duplicated or not, without having the duplicate values showing --> essentially, it is giving us a condensed list of all of the items in the list but only showing each one once

```




```{r}

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
